# sm_disassembly
 A relocatable disassembly of Super Metroid (SNES) based on P.JBoy's bank logs.

 Assembles with asar v1.81: https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar/releases/tag/v1.81


## Getting Started
 1. Have python installed. Windows users may also need to setup their PATH environment variable so python can be accessed from anywhere.
 2. Place your original, unheadered Super Metroid NTSC ROM in the root directory and name it `Super Metroid.sfc`.
 3. Run `create_data.bat` to extract assets from your original ROM.
 4. Run `build_rom.bat` to assemble the ROM from source.
